# Tips for the CKS Exam

> [Handbook](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/tc-docs/certification/lf-handbook2) and [Important instructions](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/tc-docs/certification/important-instructions-cks)

I saw everyone talking about the CKS exam being way harder than the CKA and CKAD, so, because of that, I will spend more time on hands-on labs, following some tips provided by [@mischavandenburg](https://github.com/mischavandenburg) in his youtube video: [CKS Study Guide 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l232KiJHNA), which would be:

- [CKS - Killer Shell Course on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9xfB5qaOfg)
- [Killer Shell CKS Simulators (also RBAC and Network policies from others)](https://killercoda.com/)
- [killer.sh](https://killer.sh/cks)

Additionally, almost the same tips from CKA and CKAD too:

- Get confortable with `kubectl`, use aliases if needed (but don't be obsessed about it, personally I used only `k` for `kubectl`).
- You're not alone in the exam, you can use the browser within the VM to access the Kubernetes documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/ or https://kubernetes.io/blog.
- Review your work, always double check your answers.
- Make sure to copy and paste the names correctly from the question, it's easy to make mistakes.
- Manage your time effectively, don't spend too much time on a single question, you don't have to get everything right to pass the exam.
