# The journey to CKAD certification

## Day 1 (29 Jan 2025)

CKAD course started at Kodekloud. Core Concepts reviewed, Configuration section finished, multi-container pods reviewed, Observability section finished and started the POD design section.

- 47% completed, 53% to go.

# Day 2 (05 Feb 2025)

Reviewed POD design section, Services & Networking and State Persistence. Everything similar to CKA, but with add-ons like StatefulSets, Jobs/Cronjobs, Security and Helm Fundamentals.

- 100% completed.
- Mock Exam 1: 100% (1h)

# Day 3 (17 Mar 2025)

Reviewed the 2025 updated content, mostly around kustomize.

# Day 4 (27 Nov 2025)

After a long break, I started the CKAD mock exams again. I've lost the habit and I'm letting some details slip by; I need to pay more attention to the NOTE sections and the requested specifications, nothing more than that (if they tell you to create a deployment with a single specific label, don't put any others).

- Mock Exam 2: 84% (2h)

# Day 5 (29 Nov 2025)

Still need to pay more attention to what is being asked, missing some details around resource names.

Reviewed NodePort services (depending to what is being asked, the service port might be different from the node port, the target port is the port of the pod)

CRD are just a way for you to waste time, if you are asked to create a complex CRD, just skip it and try it again in the end.

- Mock Exam 3: 84% (1h30min)
