# The journey to CKAD certification

## Day 1 (29 Jan 2025)

CKAD course started at Kodekloud. Core Concepts reviewed, Configuration section finished, multi-container pods reviewed, Observability section finished and started the POD design section.

- 47% completed, 53% to go.

# Day 2 (05 Feb 2025)

Reviewed POD design section, Services & Networking and State Persistence. Everything similar to CKA, but with add-ons like StatefulSets, Jobs/Cronjobs, Security and Helm Fundamentals.

- 100% completed.
- Mock Exam 1: 100% (1h)

# Day 3 (17 Mar 2025)

Reviewed the 2025 updated content, mostly around kustomize.

# Day 4 (27 Nov 2025)

After a long break, I started the CKAD mock exams again. I've lost the habit and I'm letting some details slip by; I need to pay more attention to the NOTE sections and the requested specifications, nothing more than that (if they tell you to create a deployment with a single specific label, don't put any others).

- Mock Exam 2: 84% (2h)

# Day 5 (29 Nov 2025)

Still need to pay more attention to what is being asked, missing some details around resource names.

Reviewed NodePort services (depending to what is being asked, the service port might be different from the node port, the target port is the port of the pod)

CRD are just a way for you to waste time, if you are asked to create a complex CRD, just skip it and try it again in the end.

- Mock Exam 3: 84% (1h30min)

# Day 6 (30 Nov 2025)

Not much to review, just need to take care of some descriptions that are not clear and not specific like this one: `The pod should not be restarted in any case if it has already exited.`. It was referencing a restartPolicy of `Never`. Also, CRDs need an extra attention, remember how to enable the status subresource, pay attention to the template provided by the exame (always copy to another file to avoid losing it).

- Mock Exam 4: 90% (1h30min)
- Mock Exam 5: 92% (1h30min)

# Day 7 (01 Dec 2025)

Need to review helm commands to be able to locate myself with repository, charts and values files without accessing the browser.

- Mock Exam 6: 100% (1h)

# Day 8 (02 Dec 2025)

- Mock Exam 7: 100% (1h10min)

# Day 9 (03 Dec 2025)

- Mock Exam 8: 100% (1h30min)

# Day 10 (04 Dec 2025)

Last day of Kodekloud CKAD mock exams. Tomorrow I will have more mock exams of Linux Foundation. Last day to check if I need to review something.

- Mock Exam 9: 100% (1h30min)

# Day 11 (05 Dec 2025)

- Killer Shell mock exam: 91% (2h)

# Day 12 (06 Dec 2025)

Exam day. It was ok, just waiting for the results (the tests were way easier compared to the Killer Shell mock exams).
