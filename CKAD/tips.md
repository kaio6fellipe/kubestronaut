## General Tips

> Almost the same tips from CKA.

- Get confortable with `kubectl`, use aliases if needed (but don't be obsessed about it, personally I used only `k` for `kubectl`).
- You're not alone in the exam, you can use the browser within the VM to access the Kubernetes documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/ or https://kubernetes.io/blog.
- Review your work, always double check your answers.
- Make sure to copy and paste the names correctly from the question, it's easy to make mistakes.
- Manage your time effectively, don't spend too much time on a single question, you don't have to get everything right to pass the exam.
