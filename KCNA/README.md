# The journey to KCNA certification

## Day 1 (11 Dec 2025)

As I started with CKA and CKAD, KCNA content will be almost 100% similar, so I will just review the content and practice with some mock exams on Kodekloud KCNA course.

- Kubernetes Fundamentals and Container Runtime Interface Quiz: 73%
- Kubernetes Resources Quiz: 83%

> For both quizzes, Kodekloud got some old questions around replication controllers and always considering docker as a default container runtime.

- 23% completed, 77% to go.

## Day 2 (19 Dec 2025)

- Kubernetes Scheduling Quiz: 85%
- Kubernetes Container Security Quiz: 80%
- Kubernetes Container Networking Quiz: 84%
- Kubernetes Service Mesh Quiz: 88%
- Kubernetes Storage Quiz: 74%

- 73% completed, 27% to go.
