# The journey to KCNA certification

## Day 1 (11 Dec 2025)

As I started with CKA and CKAD, KCNA content will be almost 100% similar, so I will just review the content and practice with some mock exams on Kodekloud KCNA course.

- Kubernetes Fundamentals and Container Runtime Interface Quiz: 73%
- Kubernetes Resources Quiz: 83%

> For both quizzes, Kodekloud got some old questions around replication controllers and always considering docker as a default container runtime.

- 23% completed, 77% to go.
