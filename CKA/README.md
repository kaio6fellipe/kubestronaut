# The journey to CKA certification

## Day 1 (11 Nov 2024)

Kodekloud is a great platform to learn and practice. As soon as I started my journey, I finished the Core Concepts in the first day (with practice tests), not a big deal 'cause I've been working with Kubernetes for a while now. Following up the kodekloud repository too: https://github.com/kodekloudhub/certified-kubernetes-administrator-course.

- 17% completed, 83% to go.
