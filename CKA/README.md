# The journey to CKA certification

## Day 1 (11 Nov 2024)

Kodekloud is a great platform to learn and practice. As soon as I started my journey, I finished the Core Concepts in the first day (with practice tests), not a big deal 'cause I've been working with Kubernetes for a while now. Following up the kodekloud repository too: https://github.com/kodekloudhub/certified-kubernetes-administrator-course.

- 17% completed, 83% to go.

## Day 2 (12 Nov 2024)

Deep dive into Scheduling. Manual Scheduling (setting the node name on the pod), Labels and Selectors, Taints and Tolerations, Node Selectors, Node Affinity, Resource Limits, DaemonSets, Static Pods (omg :mindblowing:), Multiple Schedulers and Scheduling Profiles. Also finished the Logging & Monitoring section. Pretty basic, right to the point used in the exam.

Also finished the Application Lifecycle Management section, no surprises around that. A tip to get used to kubectl operations and yaml manifests structure is to always use the `kubectl [command] --help` and the official documentation, get used to it. For me, the best section around the documentation (until now) is the Kubernetes API reference: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/.

- 42% completed, 58% to go.
